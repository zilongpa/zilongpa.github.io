          <h2>TOTP-based Attendance App</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Implemented a Next.js system on the T3 stack (tRPC, Tailwind,
              Prisma, PostgreSQL) with TOTP-encoded dynamic Data-Matrix barcodes
            </li>
            <li>
              Features offline caching for weak-network environments and Google
              OAuth; deployed serverlessly on Vercel for seamless use by
              non-technical staff
            </li>
            <li>
              Successfully tested in a 120-student underground auditorium during
              BU CS391, leading the professor to adopt it for next semester and
              invite me as a course assistant

          <h2>Interactive CPU Learning Simulator</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Built an interactive teaching CPU (DEC Beta ISA, a simplified RISC
              architecture from MIT) with step execution, live register/memory
              editing, and animated datapath visualizations
            </li>
            <li>
              Developed using React for browser-based interactive learning
              experience
            </li>
            <li>
              Released as open-source web/desktop app; adopted in BU's CS210 and
              part of the MIT teaching tradition via OpenCourseWare
            </li>

            Optimizing BU Professors' Classroom Allocation to Minimize Walking
            Cost
          </h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Built a Python/Numpy simulated-annealing scheduler with
              campus-scale distance modeling using OSMnx
            </li>
            <li>
              Achieved 97% reduction in faculty walking distance across five
              weekdays through optimization algorithms
            </li>
            <li>
              Processed and cleaned 200k+ SIS course and classroom records into
              optimization-ready datasets in under 20 minutes
            </li>
            <li>
              Enabled simulated-annealing runs within 8 GB RAM (earlier MILP
              prototype overflowed 128 GB)
            </li>

          <ul>
            <li>
              As president, directed development of a full-stack student
              platform: event registration, sponsorship management, real-time
              talent-show voting (handling 500 concurrent users and 2k+
              websocket requests/sec), accounting tools, and a secure chair
              election portal.
            </li>
            <li>
              Built an LLM onboarding assistant by engaging the student
              community to contribute multilingual QA pairs and fine-tuning
              Qwen-2.5 with RAG on BU resources, creating a collaborative
              onboarding tool for FAQs on housing, transport, culture, and
              careers.
            </li>
            <li>
              Platform serves 1k registered users, 3.5k unique monthly visitors,
              and 77k monthly requests; enabled cross-department collaboration
              within a 120-member association, partnerships with campus clubs,
              BU administration, and the Eastern/Central US CSSA Alliance.
            </li>
            <li>
              Recruited new developers, mentored junior members, and drove a
              cloud cost-reduction strategy—cutting spend by 30% through
              diversifying infrastructure and reducing reliance on AWS.
